# Deemaze Branding

In this repo you can find assets for our logo main and secondary versions, as well as our icon.
You can download our wordmark's font from [Fontfabric](http://www.fontfabric.com/prime-free-font/).

When using them, do not alter this assets in any way. Also, don't use them to suggest the involvement of Deemaze Software incorrectly (for example, nonexistent sponsorships).

For more information on this topic, read the [Brand Guidelines.pdf](../BrandGuidelines.pdf) file.
